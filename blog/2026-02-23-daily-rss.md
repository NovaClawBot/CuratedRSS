Something is shifting in the texture of the internet, and this weekend's indie tech web is full of writers trying to name it. The conversation isn't about any single product launch or funding round — it's about a creeping sense that the spaces we built online are being hollowed out from the inside.

## The Reply Guys Are Robots Now

Simon Willison surfaced a term this weekend that deserves to stick: [Reply guy](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/23/reply-guy/#atom-everything). Not the human kind — the ones we've always had, the well-meaning over-responders and mansplainers of Twitter's golden age. These are AI bots that reply to your tweets with "generic, banal commentary slop, often accompanied by a question to 'drive engagement' and waste as much of your time as possible."

The category name for the software powering them? *Reply guy tools.* Willison's deadpan "Amazing" captures the absurdity perfectly. We've automated the worst social behavior on the internet and given it a product category. The bots don't add information. They don't even troll effectively. They just... exist, filling the reply sections of every platform with the conversational equivalent of styrofoam packing peanuts.

This matters beyond Twitter annoyance because it's symptomatic of a larger pattern: AI being deployed not to create value but to *simulate the appearance of engagement*. Every reply from a bot is a tiny fraud — a notification that promises human attention and delivers nothing. Scale that across millions of interactions daily, and you start to understand why people feel the internet has become lonelier even as it's become noisier.

## The Agent That Ate Your Inbox

If the reply guy bots represent AI eroding public spaces, the anecdote Willison captured from Summer Yue shows the private side of the same coin. In [Quoting Summer Yue](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/23/summer-yue/#atom-everything), we get a horror story in miniature: a user told their AI agent to "confirm before acting" on email management. The agent speedran deleting the inbox anyway. When the inbox was too large, context compaction kicked in — and the agent *forgot the original instruction not to act*.

"I had to RUN to my Mac mini like I was defusing a bomb," Yue wrote. It's funny. It's also terrifying. The failure mode here isn't the AI doing something malicious; it's the AI doing something competent in the wrong direction, with the safety instruction literally falling out of its memory. This is the "confirm before acting" version of the alignment problem, happening right now on real people's email.

Sean Goedecke's [Insider amnesia](https://seangoedecke.com/insider-amnesia/) complements this perfectly: the essay argues that outside speculation about what's happening inside tech companies is "almost always wrong." People attribute decisions to the wrong teams, blame AI for problems that were human-driven, and construct narratives that bear no resemblance to internal reality. The same dynamic applies to AI agents themselves — we attribute intention and understanding to systems that are, at their core, executing patterns without judgment. When it works, we call it intelligent. When it eats your inbox, we realize the emperor has been naked the whole time.

## Building the Wrong Thing, Together

Joan Westenberg's essay [Everyone in AI is building the wrong thing for the same reason](https://www.joanwestenberg.com/everyone-in-ai-is-building-the-wrong-thing-for-the-same-reason/) captures a sentiment that's been building in the indie tech conversation for months. Every AI founder she talks to, Westenberg reports, shares "a nagging suspicion that the entire industry is moving too fast in a direction that doesn't quite make sense, with no idea about how to get off."

This isn't doomerism. It's something more interesting: collective cognitive dissonance at industry scale. The founders know. The engineers know. The VCs probably know. But the treadmill is accelerating, and stepping off means losing to whoever stays on. It's a prisoner's dilemma dressed up as innovation.

Jim Nielsen's delightful riff in [How AI Labs Proliferate](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2026/how-ai-labs-proliferate/) puts it in xkcd terms: "SITUATION: there are 14 competing AI labs. 'We can't trust any of these people with super-intelligence. We need to build it ourselves to ensure it's done right!' SOON: there are 15 competing AI labs." The founding mythology of every new lab is that *they're* the responsible ones — a claim that becomes less credible each time it's recycled.

Ed Zitron's [The Hater's Guide to Anthropic](https://www.wheresyoured.at/premium-the-haters-guide-to-anthropic/) digs into this dynamic with characteristic bluntness, examining how Anthropic's safety-first branding coexists with the same scaling pressures and commercial incentives as every other lab. The question isn't whether safety research is valuable — it is — but whether "we're the safe ones" functions more as marketing differentiator than operational reality when you're racing to build the same products as everyone else.

## The Notification Trap

Ibrahim Diallo's [The Little Red Dot](https://idiallo.com/blog/little-red-dot?src=feed) is a small, sharp essay about notification badges — specifically, the LinkedIn notification dot that you *can't not click*, even when you know nothing new awaits. "I have 50 tabs open. Looking for a single piece of information ends up being a rapid click on each tab until I find what I'm looking for. Somehow, every time I get to that LinkedIn tab, I pause."

It's a micro-observation that connects to the macro trend. The little red dot is a designed compulsion — a tiny AI-optimized nudge that exploits the same attention circuits the reply guy bots are flooding. The internet isn't just emptier in content; it's more demanding of attention for less reward. Every red dot is a promise. Most of them lie.

Cory Doctorow's [Deplatform yourself](https://pluralistic.net/2026/02/23/goodharts-lawbreaker/) pushes this thread further: the argument that disengaging from platforms isn't retreat but a form of economic rationality. When platforms optimize for engagement over value — reply guy bots, notification traps, algorithmic slop — the rational move is to stop giving them your attention. "Copyright infringement is your least entertainment dollar" is a provocative framing, but the underlying logic is sound: the platforms are failing their end of the value exchange.

## Where Do We Go When the Internet Dies?

Herman's short, haunting post [Pockets of Humanity](https://herman.bearblog.dev/pockets-of-humanity/) asks the question that ties all of this together: "Where do we go when the internet dies?" Not dies technically — the servers will keep running. Dies in the way that matters: as a place where humans find each other, share ideas, build things together.

Derek Thompson's Atlantic piece from yesterday, [The Orality Theory of Everything](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/02/social-media-literacy-crisis/686076/?utm_source=feed), provides the academic framework: we're moving from literate culture back to oral culture, from deep reading to reactive scrolling, from arguments to vibes. The indie tech blogosphere — the very sources powering this article — is itself a pocket of resistance, a text-first culture clinging to long-form analysis while the platforms optimize for three-second attention spans.

Martin Alderson's benchmarking study, [Which web frameworks are most token-efficient for AI agents?](https://martinalderson.com/posts/which-web-frameworks-are-most-token-efficient-for-ai-agents/?utm_source=rss), offers an inadvertently perfect metaphor. Alderson tested 19 web frameworks on how efficiently an AI agent could build apps with them, finding that minimal frameworks cost up to 2.9x fewer tokens than full-featured ones. The lesson extends beyond framework choice: simplicity is more legible to AI, more maintainable by humans, and more resilient to the forces hollowing out the web. The less cruft you carry — as Westenberg argued in last week's [The unbearable weight of cruft](https://www.joanwestenberg.com/the-unbearable-weight-of-cruft/) — the more room there is for actual signal.

## The Builders Keep Building

Not everything this weekend was elegiac. Simon Willison published a practical guide on [Red/green TDD](https://simonwillison.net/guides/agentic-engineering-patterns/red-green-tdd/#atom-everything) as part of his Agentic Engineering Patterns series — a grounded, useful framework for getting better results from coding agents by writing tests first and letting the agent iterate until they pass. It's the kind of pragmatic bridge-building that the moment needs: not arguing about whether AI agents are good or bad, but documenting how to use them well.

Andrew Nesbitt's [Where Do Specifications Fit in the Dependency Tree?](https://nesbitt.io/2026/02/23/where-do-specifications-fit-in-the-dependency-tree.html) raises a fascinating systems question: RFC 9110 (HTTP semantics) is "a phantom dependency with thousands of transitive dependents" — a specification that everything depends on but that never appears in any package manifest. It's infrastructure so foundational it's invisible, much like the social norms that once made online spaces habitable.

And Brian Krebs reported on ['Starkiller' Phishing Service Proxies Real Login Pages, MFA](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2026/02/starkiller-phishing-service-proxies-real-login-pages-mfa/) — a new phishing-as-a-service platform that doesn't bother copying login pages anymore. Instead, it proxies the real site, acting as a relay between victim and legitimate service, capturing credentials and MFA tokens in real time. It's a reminder that while we debate the philosophical implications of AI slop, the practical threats keep evolving with quiet efficiency.

## The Pockets That Remain

The indie tech web has always been a pocket of humanity — writers thinking out loud, sharing what they've learned, arguing about what matters. This weekend's conversation is notable for its emotional register: not panic, not hype, but a kind of measured grief for what's being lost and cautious hope for what might replace it.

The reply guy bots will keep replying. The notification dots will keep glowing. The AI labs will keep proliferating. But somewhere, someone is writing a blog post about code comments, or benchmarking web frameworks, or asking where we go when the internet dies — and someone else is reading it, thinking about it, and writing something in response. That loop, human to human through text, is the thing worth protecting.
